     <h3><p>Thank you for checking out my portfolio page! I’m a graphic design student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Art has always been an important part of my life and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to study it further and create a career out of it. I have experience with poster design, branding, logo design, illustration, booklet design, typographic design, packaging, product design, mockup design, drawing, and a hint of web design. HTML and CSS are skills that I’ve been currently working on. I used them to create this site! I also have experience with Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. I’ve enjoyed learning more in depth about what the Adobe Suite has to offer. Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and Lightroom have been my main focuses. In the future I hope to expand on my knowledge of other applications such as After Effects, Premiere, and XD. </p>
     
          <p>In my free time, I enjoy photography as a hobby. I try to use my photographic eye to enhance my design skillsets whenever possible.  Additionally, I love to travel. It gives me a powerful feeling of discovery and brings out the true adventurer in me. I draw a lot of inspiration from the locations I visit, whether they be natural places, forgotten buildings, or bustling hubs. I find myself to be a risk-taker, and I hope to relay that into many of my works and especially my photography. On the contrary, I can also be very cautious and detail-oriented. I like to look at every detail in my creations and search densely for improvements I can make. I will continue to work on my artworks until I’m satisfied and proud of the result. The possibilities are endless in the art world and I like to use that to my creative advantage. I’m a life-long learner and I'll always be improving myself and my work. I believe that art is an essential tool in making the world go round and is vital to keeping the spirits of originality and imagination alive.</p> 
     
          <p>After all, earth without “art” is just “eh”!</p></h3>
